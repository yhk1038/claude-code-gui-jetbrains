/**
 * Tracks which files Claude Code edits so the IDE can be told to reload them.
 *
 * Why this exists: the Claude CLI writes files to disk directly (after a
 * permission is granted, or automatically in acceptEdits/bypass modes). The
 * plugin never goes through the IDE to perform the write, so the IDE only
 * learns about the change through its native filesystem watcher. On Windows
 * that watcher is unreliable, leaving open editor tabs showing stale content
 * (issue #72). To work around it we detect completed edit tools in the CLI
 * stream and explicitly ask the IDE to refresh the affected paths.
 *
 * Timing matters: an `assistant` event only announces the *intent* to edit —
 * in ask-before-edit mode the file is not written until the user approves and
 * the matching `tool_result` comes back. So we record edit targets when the
 * tool_use is seen, but only emit a refresh once the corresponding successful
 * `tool_result` arrives (= the write has actually happened on disk).
