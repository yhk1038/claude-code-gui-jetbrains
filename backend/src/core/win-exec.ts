/**
 * Windows-only: run an external launcher through cmd.exe with an argv ARRAY so
 * Node applies its standard CommandLineToArgvW quoting and NO shell tokenization
 * happens on the individual arguments.
 *
 * ## Why this exists (shell-tokenization avoidance — the project's established pattern)
 *
 * On win32 the CLIs we drive (`claude`, `npm`, `brew`, ...) are launcher wrappers
 * (`.cmd`/`.ps1`/`.exe`). execFile cannot run a `.cmd` without a shell (ENOENT),
 * so the naïve fix is `shell: true`. But `shell: true` hands the whole command
 * line to cmd.exe as a STRING, which then splits on spaces and expands
 * metacharacters. A launcher path like `C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd` or a
 * variable argument then gets torn apart at the space (the v0.22.x defect).
 *
 * The fix — mirrored from Claude.execViaCmd — is to spawn cmd.exe ourselves as
 * the executed FILE (a `.exe`, so Node's batch-file caret hardening for
 * CVE-2024-27980 does not fire) and pass the real launcher + args as separate
 * argv ELEMENTS. Node double-quotes each element, so spaces and `& | < >` are
 * literal and injection is blocked.
 *
 * ## The `%` caveat
 *
 * cmd.exe still expands `%VAR%` even inside double quotes, which would silently
 * corrupt an argument. Per the original-data-preservation rule we fail loudly
 * (see [assertNoCmdPercentExpansion]) rather than run a mangled command. Callers
 * here pass fixed, well-known argv (`update`, `view <pkg> dist-tags --json`,
 * `upgrade <cask>`), none of which contain `%`, so this guard is a safety net.
 *
 * macOS/Linux never reach this function; callers branch on `process.platform`.
