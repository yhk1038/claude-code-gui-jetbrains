/**
 * Restores persisted Claude Code chat sessions after an IDE restart.
 *
 * Host-agnostic: it asks the [ChatHostRouter] for the current host and lets it
 * restore its own sessions. Because the persisted state
 * ([com.github.yhk1038.claudecodegui.services.EditorTabStateService]) is shared
 * across hosts, switching `hostMode` and restarting naturally restores the same
 * session list into whichever host is now current.
 *
 * ## First-open timing race (PR #146)
 *
 * The host is chosen from the cached `hostMode` ([HostModeCache]). The backend is
 * the single source of truth for that value and pushes it over RPC on connect —
 * but on a fresh install the backend has not started yet when this activity runs,
 * so the cache is still empty and a naive read would fall back to EDITOR_TAB,
 * ignoring a "Sidebar" (tool-window) choice.
 *
 * This activity is the **only** place that closes that race: when it has sessions
 * to restore but the cache is empty, it briefly prewarms the backend (a transient
 * no-op panel) and awaits the first HOST_MODE_CHANGED push, bounded by
 * [HOST_MODE_AWAIT_TIMEOUT_MS], before deciding the host. Every other entry point
 * (the "+" button, Cmd+N, the popup, the tool-window factory) keeps reading the
 * persistent cache synchronously with zero delay — by then the value is present.
 *
 * The wait is skipped entirely when the already-cached value is non-empty (the
 * common case, since [com.intellij.ide.util.PropertiesComponent] persists it) or
 * when there are no persisted sessions to restore.
