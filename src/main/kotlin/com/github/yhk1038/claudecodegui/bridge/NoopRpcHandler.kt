/**
 * A [NodeProcessManager.RpcHandler] that ignores every request.
 *
 * Used when a caller only needs the backend *process* to be running (so its RPC
 * socket connects and the backend can push state such as HOST_MODE_CHANGED) but
 * has no panel to service IDE-side requests. Registered against a transient panel
 * id and released once the caller is done.
 *
 * Shared by [com.github.yhk1038.claudecodegui.actions.SendSelectionToClaudeAction]
 * (send-selection prewarm) and
 * [com.github.yhk1038.claudecodegui.startup.ChatHostRestoreActivity] (awaiting the
 * first hostMode push to close the PR #146 first-open race).
