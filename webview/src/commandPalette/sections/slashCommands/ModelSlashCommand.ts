/**
 * The CLI advertises `/model` in its command list but rejects it in stream-json
 * mode ("/model isn't available in this environment"), so passing it through
 * like a normal command (CliPassthroughCommand) never switches the model.
 * Instead we intercept it and drive our own model switch — the same set_model
 * path the "Switch model" overlay uses — which honours CLI equivalence ("what
 * the user does with /model in the CLI works in the GUI").
 *
 * - "/model"        → opens the model picker overlay.
 * - "/model sonnet" → opens the overlay carrying "sonnet" as a query so it
 *                     resolves the model and switches immediately.
