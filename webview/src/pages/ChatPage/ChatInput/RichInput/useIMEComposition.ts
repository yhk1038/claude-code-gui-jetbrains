/**
 * useIMEComposition — the single, ref-only source of truth for IME composition
 * state in the composer.
 *
 * Why this exists: under JCEF (embedded Chromium) `KeyboardEvent.isComposing`
 * is unreliable — it can read false during an active composition and true just
 * after it ends. Relying on it makes a plain Enter in a non-English layout get
 * consumed as a composition "commit", so no newline is produced (issue #215).
 * We therefore track composition ourselves from the composition lifecycle plus
 * the keyCode-229 signal.
 *
 * Why refs, not React state: updating state mid-composition triggers a
 * re-render, and under JCEF that re-render duplicates/stutters the in-progress
 * glyphs. All state here lives in refs so composition never causes a render.
 *
 * Transitions are synchronous (no requestAnimationFrame): during fast Hangul
 * typing a deferred reset would race the next compositionstart and briefly
 * report the wrong state. A short {@link FALLBACK_RESET_MS} timer is the only
 * async piece, and it exists purely as a safety net for IMEs that abandon a
 * composition without a trailing event.
