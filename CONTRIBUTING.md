## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Node.js** | >= 18 | Required for backend and webview |
| **pnpm** | Latest | Package manager (`npm install -g pnpm`) |
| **JDK** | 21 | Required for Kotlin plugin build |
| **Claude Code CLI** | >= 1.0.0 | Must be installed and authenticated (`claude --version`) |

## Project Architecture

The plugin consists of three layers:

```
claude-code-gui-jetbrains/
├── backend/         # Node.js + TypeScript — WebSocket server, Claude CLI runner
├── webview/         # React + Vite + Tailwind — Chat UI (runs in JCEF browser)
└── src/             # Kotlin — JetBrains plugin shell (spawns Node.js, native IDE APIs)
```

**Data flow:**

```
JetBrains IDE (Kotlin)
  └─ spawns Node.js backend (WebSocket server)
       └─ runs Claude Code CLI
       └─ serves WebView UI via WebSocket
```

- **Backend** is the only backend. All business logic (sessions, settings, CLI execution, file I/O) lives here.
- **WebView** is a pure client. It communicates with the backend over WebSocket, never directly with Kotlin.
- **Kotlin** is the IDE shell. It spawns the Node.js process and provides native IDE APIs (editor tabs, diff viewer) via a Bridge interface.

## Development Setup

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yhk1038/claude-code-gui-jetbrains.git
cd claude-code-gui-jetbrains

# Install backend dependencies
bash ./scripts/build.sh be-install

# Install webview dependencies
bash ./scripts/build.sh wv-install
```

### 2. Run in development mode

**Option A: Full plugin (in a sandboxed IDE)**

```bash
bash ./scripts/build.sh all
```

This builds everything and launches a sandboxed JetBrains IDE with the plugin loaded.

**Option B: WebView only (in browser)**

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the backend dev server
bash ./scripts/build.sh be-dev

# Terminal 2: Start the webview dev server
bash ./scripts/build.sh wv-dev
```

Open the URL shown by Vite (usually `http://localhost:5173`). This runs the full product in the browser — it is not a mock environment.

### 3. Verify your setup

```bash
# Run webview tests
bash ./scripts/build.sh wv-test

# Type-check backend
bash ./scripts/build.sh be-lint

# Type-check webview
bash ./scripts/build.sh wv-lint

# Full plugin build
bash ./scripts/build.sh build
```

## Build Commands

All builds go through `bash ./scripts/build.sh`. Do **not** run `cd`, `pnpm`, or `./gradlew` directly.

Run `bash ./scripts/build.sh -h` for the full list. Key commands:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `be-install` / `wv-install` | Install dependencies |
| `be-build` / `wv-build` | Build backend / webview |
| `be-lint` / `wv-lint` | Type-check backend / webview |
| `wv-test` | Run webview tests |
| `build` | Build the Gradle plugin |
| `full-build` | Build all three layers |
| `run-ide` | Launch sandboxed IDE |
| `all` | Full build + launch IDE |
| `clear-cache` | Clean all build artifacts |

## Development Workflow

### Browser-first development

For UI and backend work, develop in the browser (`be-dev` + `wv-dev`). This gives you:
- Hot module replacement for instant feedback
- Browser DevTools for debugging
- No need to rebuild the Kotlin plugin on every change

Only switch to `run-ide` when you need to test IDE-specific features (editor tabs, diff viewer, native dialogs).

### Running tests

```bash
# WebView unit tests
bash ./scripts/build.sh wv-test

# Watch mode (re-runs on file change)
bash ./scripts/build.sh wv-test-watch
```

## Code Style

### General

- **Language**: All code, comments, variable names, and commit messages must be in **English**.
- **Exports**: Use named exports. No `export default`.
- **Barrel files** (`index.ts`): Use `export * from './foo'` (wildcard re-export).

### React / TypeScript (WebView)

**Props declaration:**

```tsx
interface Props {
  className?: string;
}

export const MyComponent = (props: Props) => {
  const { className } = props;
  // ...
};
```

- Interface name is always `Props`
- Parameter is always `props: Props` (no destructuring in the signature)
- Destructure at the top of the component body

**Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS classes. No inline `style={{}}`.

**Domain models:** Use `class` (not `interface`) for domain objects. Convert plain objects to class instances at system boundaries with `plainToInstance()`.

**File size:** If a component file exceeds ~100 lines, extract it into a folder:

```
MyComponent/
├── index.tsx        # Main component (named export matching folder name)
├── SubPart.tsx      # Extracted sub-component
└── types.ts         # Shared types
```

### Commit Messages

- Written in **English**
- Follow conventional style: `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.
- Keep the first line under 72 characters

## Core Principles

These principles are non-negotiable and take priority over convenience. See
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full rationale.

- **CLI equivalence & no official-SDK dependency.** Anything a user can do from
  the `claude` CLI must be doable from the GUI, and features must be built on the
  public CLI contract — never on the official SDK library or undocumented internal
  protocols. Reference apps (Cursor, etc.) are copied for their **UX only**, not
  for their internal implementation means.
- **Preserve original data structures.** Claude Code's original data (JSONL
  entries, session metadata) must reach the WebView with its per-entry structure
  unedited: no field renaming, no dropping fields the current UI doesn't use.
  Range-splitting (pagination / active-chain view) is allowed as long as each
  entry stays structurally intact and the full data remains reachable.
- **Consistent naming.** The same action uses the same verb everywhere (method,
  IPC message type, handler). All IPC message `type`s use the `MessageType` enum
  (mirrored in `webview/src/shared` ↔ `backend/src/shared`), never plain string
  literals.

## Submitting Changes

### Before you start

- For bug fixes, open an issue first (or find an existing one)
- For new features or large changes, **open an issue to discuss** before writing code

### Pull request process

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`
2. Make your changes following the code style and core principles above
3. **Rebase onto the latest `main` before opening the PR.** Always pull the newest
   `main` and rebase your branch on top of it so the PR applies cleanly on the
   current tip — do not open a PR from a stale base.
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git rebase origin/main
   ```
4. **Write feature docs for feature PRs.** Any user-facing feature must ship with a
   doc under `docs/features/NNN-feature_name/` (per-language `en.md` / `ko.md`,
   …) plus one index line in `docs/features/CLAUDE.md`. See
   [docs/features/CLAUDE.md](docs/features/CLAUDE.md) for the format.
5. **Do not use marketplace-forbidden APIs.** JetBrains **Internal** APIs
   (`@ApiStatus.Internal`, anything under an `impl` package) are forbidden — they
   fail the Marketplace Plugin Verifier. Avoid **Deprecated** APIs too (they raise
   warnings). When a native capability needs a risky API, gate it behind reflection
   or a public alternative.
6. **Ensure cross-platform safety.** Any code that can touch the OS must work on
   Windows, macOS, and Linux. **Windows is not a single environment** — treat
   `cmd`, PowerShell, **WSL**, and **WSL2** as distinct shells. Use `path.join()`
   (not hardcoded `/`), `os.tmpdir()` (not `/tmp`); avoid Unix-only commands
   (`which`, `chmod`, POSIX pipes) and signals (`SIGKILL`); account for `\r\n`
   vs `\n`, `HOME` vs `USERPROFILE`, and PATH asymmetry on WSL (inherit it via a
   login shell, e.g. `bash -lic`).
7. Ensure all checks pass (tests cover all three layers — WebView / Backend / Kotlin):
   ```bash
   bash ./scripts/build.sh wv-test
   bash ./scripts/build.sh wv-lint
   bash ./scripts/build.sh be-lint
   bash ./scripts/build.sh full-build
   ```
8. Write a clear PR description explaining **what** you changed and **why**
9. Submit the PR against `main`
